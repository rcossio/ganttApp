# GanttApp

I made this because Click*p charges 7 USD if you see your tasks in a Gantt chart too many times, even as a single user.

## Notes
- Feat: Add an assigned person per task.
- Feat: The timeline should be scrollable horizontally by dragging the empty space at the bottom.
- Feat: the render module attatched events to all three buttons for groups/tasks, it is better to have a function per component that handles its own events.
- Feat: The timeline should have a vertical scrollbar if the tasks exceed the height of the screen.
