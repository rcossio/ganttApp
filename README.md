# GanttApp

I made this because Click*p charges 7 USD if you see your tasks in a Gantt chart too many times, even as a single user.

## Next steps
- Fix: the app is getting slow, probably because it calculates to many stuff on the fly
- Fix: When hiding weekends, a task that starts or ends on a weekend is not displayed correctly

- Feat: Add an assigned person per task.
- Feat: dragging groups and task to reorder them 
- Feat: the vertical scroll should not move the header
- Feat: dark theme icon and dark theme support
- Feat: Double left-clicking should enable task name editing, on-site
- Feat: The task menu could open from both the task row or the task block
- Feat: Set the name of the task to the left of the view when the name is not visible (the center is to the right)
