# GanttApp

I made this because Click*p charges 7 USD if you see your tasks in a Gantt chart too many times, even as a single user.

## Next steps
- TODO: the app is getting slow, probably because it calculates to many stuff on the fly
- Add an assigned person per task.
- Dragging groups and task to reorder them 
- The vertical scroll should not move the header
- Dark theme icon and dark theme support
- Double left-clicking should enable task name editing, on-site
- The task menu could open from both the task row or the task block
- Set the name of the task to the left of the view when the name is not visible (the center is to the right)
- Scrolling vetically should move the tasks menus (but not members menu). Currently the tasks menu is fixed.
- Right clicking on a task should darken the task when the menu is open
- Bigger screens should have a zoom range more near 0.2-5.0. Set better limits depending on the screen size.
- Pressing enter key should save the member being added when completing the member input
- Member initials and emails should have a max length
- Enable draggin from the months/days rows
- Position popup should appear next to the cursor if the position is outside the screen
- Set a list of undoable tasks by ctrl+z, like changing task name, adding a member, etc.
- Right clicking on a day should open a menu to add the day as non-working day (like weekends)
- When adding a new task, a shrinken group should be expanded (toggle the group in the expanded state) 
- Not sure: Set group background in darker color. May be too invasive
